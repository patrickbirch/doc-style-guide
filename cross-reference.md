# Use Cross-References Appropriately
----------------------------------

By using cross-references in manuals and in similar documents, you delegate telling part of your story to another part of your document or to entirely another document. After reading the cross-referenced material, the reader should be able to return to the current story.

On the other hand, in documents that are used as references, for example, release notes, glossaries, or indexes, a cross-reference is a helpful tool and should be used frequently. These reference documents are not read from cover to cover: the reader must quickly locate the most specific information.Â
