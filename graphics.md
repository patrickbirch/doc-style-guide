# Graphics

Graphical objects such as diagrams or screenshots illustrate explanations given in text form in the same section. If possible, consider using image formats that support keeping the graphics up to date and putting them under revision control (e.g. an SVG file, or embed graphics using ascii art tools like [ditaa](http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/), [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) or [blockdiag](http://blockdiag.com/en/), et. al).

## * Rules

Add a caption to each diagram or screenshot.
