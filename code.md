# Code descriptions

It’s recommended to split the command and its output into separate blocks

## Rules

* Write code samples for package installation without -y flag
* Don’t use screenshots for code samples. Give the ability for users to copy & paste the code
* Use spaces, instead of tabs for indentation
* Remove white space from the end of lines (= no trailing tabs or spaces)
* For code samples, use the following prompts:

## Examples 

```text
$> type a command here
#> type command as root here
mysql> type a Percona Server for MySQL statement here
```
