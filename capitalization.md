# Capitalization

If in doubt donâ€™t capitalize.

## Rules

* Capitalize all proper names. When referring to GUI elements, match the capitalization used on the interface
* Use sentence-style capitalization in headings and captions
* In text, capitalize the first word after a colon if it starts a complete sentence. In headings, always capitalize the first word after the colon.
