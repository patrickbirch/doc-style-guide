Many readers are not fluent in English and may find some grammatical structures (which are quite popular in English) confusing.

## Rules

*   Do not use \*multiple attributes\* that precede a noun.
*   Do not omit \*that\* which introduces a subordinate clause.
*   Do not use such forms of expression as _jargon_ or _metaphors._
*   Do not use synonyms. Each concept should be referred to by only one term.
*   Reuse terms when referring to the facts you have already stated instead of using pronouns such as _it_, _they_, and so on to refer back to them.
