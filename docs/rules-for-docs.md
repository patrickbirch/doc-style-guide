# Rules for specific documentation types

## Manuals

*   Do not cross-reference totally new material that the reader might not understand based on the current context.
*   Give references to material that may become outdated, such as external resources, in the **See also** section at the end of the current section.
*   Do not make cross-references a continuation of the current story: readers should be able to understand the current section even if they decide not to read the cross-referenced material.

## Reference Documents

*   Cross-reference each occurrence of valuable assets, such as identifiers of JIRA tickets, bug reports, or security issues. However, make sure that you do not refer the reader to restricted information which may not be disclosed in the given document.
