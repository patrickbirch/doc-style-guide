# Headings

Use the imperative mood.

Write titles using short, descriptive words

Focus on what the user can do rather than describe a feature

Rules

* Do not use stacked headings: a subsection heading immediately following a section heading
* Avoid using one or two-word headings
* Write brief but descriptive headings
* Keep the structure of headings of the same level grammatically aligned
* Avoid formatting headings (italic, bold, underlined, etc.) and using abbreviations (because they should be introduced first)
* Donâ€™t end headings with a period or a colon
* There should be only one H1 in the document
