## General guidelines

In English, a mood indicates how a verb expresses an action or state of being. The three moods are:

* Indicative
* Imperative
* Subjunctive

An Indicative mood is used to make a factual statement:

* The software runs in the Linux operating system.
* When starting, the application checks to see if another instance is running.

An imperative mood is used to express commands or requests:

* Open the pod bay doors, Hal
* Run the command from the terminal

A subjunctive mood is infrequently used and often is used when suggesting or recommending an action. The subjunctive mood may cause doubt.

* It is important that only administrators should read the log
* The example shows a type of variable you could use when starting the application

When writing, use either the indicative or imperative mood. Use the subjunctive mood when the information may be different for different users, such as presenting the output of a command (Your results should be similar).

**Guidelines**:

* Wrap lines at 80 characters
* Filenames. Suggestion: Use a “-“ as a word separator in filename
