# Links

Links are used to reference other parts of the document, other documents, and resources.

## Rules

* Do not refer to `here`, `see this page`, etc. Use the title of doc, section heading, name of the resource, or provide the full URL (not recommended).
* When linking to another section, another document, or resource, use the following construction: *_For more information [about ...], see ..._* (Example: For more information about using Docker, see [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).)
