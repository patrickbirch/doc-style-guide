# Tables

Tables are a way to represent a sequence of items each of which is described by its attributes. Tabular data are organized either by columns or by rows.

In the column representation, the top row contains names of the attributes which describe items on the following rows. In the row representation, the first column contains the names of the attributes.

For items that are characterized by two dimensions, it is useful to have tables where one set of attributes appears as column titles and the other set (or dimension) appears as row titles.

## Rules

* Add a lead-in paragraph.
* Do not use consecutive tables.
* Avoid using tables with columns or row spans.
