# Paragraphs

A complicated syntax structures require additional effort to comprehend.

## Rules

* Break up long paragraphs (longer than 3-7 lines)
* Make your text scannable: add sections, break paragraphs into lists
* Do not use sentences with more than two clauses. Put conditional clauses before the instructions (e.g. For more information, see [link to the document])
* Organize sentences in an intuitive manner. Move from common to specific, from known to unknown.
