# Lists

Lists are used to organize information with a common subject or in a particular sequence.

## Rules

* Each list has an introductory sentence/paragraph. The introductory sentence can be either a complete sentence or a partial sentence. End the introductory sentence with a colon.

* Align the grammatical structure of every item in a list. For example, start each item with a noun or a verb. Avoid using an article.

* Make lists 2-7 items long. Transform shorter lists into paragraphs. Split too-long lists into several lists.

* A multilevel list may not have more than two levels of nesting. The shortest sub-list is allowed to consist of two items at least.

* A multilevel list should be balanced where each list item has a similar number of sub-items.

* Avoid inline lists unless you enumerate simple known facts. Inline lists should not contain more than five items.

* Use sentence punctuation if every item in a list is a sentence.

* Do not use any punctuation, such as commas or semicolons, if list items are not sentences.

* Use numbered lists if the order of items matters.

* Use bullet lists if the order of items does not matter.

* Use numbered lists if in doubt.
