# Documentation Style Guide

This style guide enables implementing the principle of simple documentation. While there may be different ways to understand what simple documentation is, this style guide sticks to the following definition:

> Simple documentation is a source of information about a software product which enables the target audience to use the product effectively and efficiently, discover new features, and easily locate all available information about the topics they are interested in by using their own language.

This definition implies that the documentation is perceived by the target audience to be simple. The structure and underlying routines, however, may be as complex as necessary.
