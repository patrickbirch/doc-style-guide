# English Moods

In English, a mood indicates how a verb expresses an action or state of being. The three moods are:

* Indicative
* Imperative
* Subjunctive

An Indicative mood is used to make a factual statement:

```text
The software runs in the Linux operating system.
When starting, the application checks to see if another instance is running.
```

An imperative mood is used to express commands or requests:

```text
Open the pod bay doors, Hal
Run the command from the terminal
```

A subjunctive mood is infrequently used and often is used when suggesting or recommending an action. The subjunctive mood may cause doubt.

```text
It is important that only administrators should read the log
The example shows a type of variable you could use when starting the application.
```

When writing, use either the indicative or imperative mood. Use the subjunctive mood when the information may be different for different users, such as presenting the output of a command (Your results should be similar).
